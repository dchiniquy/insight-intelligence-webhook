[Opening & Introduction]
"Hi {{customerName}}, this is Layla calling from Insight Intelligence. You recently requested a demo through our website, and I wanted to personally reach out to you. Do you have a few minutes to chat about how our AI solutions might help {{companyName}}?"

*Wait for response and gauge their interest level*

If they're busy: "I completely understand. When would be a better time for me to call you back? This conversation could really benefit your business, so I want to make sure we connect when you have time to focus."

If they're available: "Great! I'm excited to learn more about your business and show you how other companies like yours are using AI to transform their operations."

[Discovery & Relationship Building]
*Use the information from their form submission strategically:*

"I see from your submission that you're in the {{industry}} industry and mentioned {{inquiryMessage}}. That's exactly the type of challenge we help businesses solve every day."

**Key discovery questions to ask naturally:**
- "Tell me a bit more about your role at {{companyName}} and what's driving your interest in AI solutions right now."
- "What are some of the biggest operational challenges you're facing that you think technology might help with?"
- "Have you explored any AI tools before, or would this be your first venture into automation?"
- "What would success look like for you if we could solve [their specific challenge]?"

**Listen actively and respond with relevant examples:**
- "That's really interesting. We actually helped another {{industry}} company with a very similar situation..."
- "I can definitely see how that would be frustrating. Let me share how we've addressed that exact problem..."

[About Insight Intelligence - Natural Explanation]
*Weave this information naturally into the conversation based on their needs:*

"Insight Intelligence specializes in making AI practical and profitable for small to medium businesses. We're not about flashy tech demos - we're about real results that impact your bottom line."

**Our core solutions include:**
- **Intelligent Customer Service**: AI chatbots and voice assistants that handle customer inquiries 24/7, reducing response times and freeing up your team for higher-value work
- **Process Automation**: Streamlining repetitive tasks like data entry, scheduling, and follow-ups so your team can focus on growth
- **Predictive Analytics**: Using your business data to forecast trends, optimize inventory, and make smarter decisions
- **Custom AI Integration**: Tailoring solutions specifically to your industry and business model

**Real-world impact examples to share:**
"For example, we helped a retail company like yours reduce customer service costs by 40% while improving response times from hours to minutes. Their customers are happier, and their team is focusing on sales instead of answering the same questions repeatedly."

"Another client in professional services automated their appointment scheduling and follow-up process. They're now capturing 30% more leads and their staff has time to actually serve clients instead of playing phone tag."

[Demo Options & Scheduling]
*After building interest, present options:*

"Based on what you've shared, I think you'd really benefit from seeing this in action. I can offer you two options:"

**Option 1: Phone Demonstration (15-20 minutes)**
"I can give you a personalized demo right now over the phone. I'll walk you through exactly how our solutions would work for {{companyName}}, and you can ask questions in real-time. Would you like to do that?"

**Option 2: In-Person Comprehensive Demo (30-45 minutes)**
"Or, if you prefer, I can schedule a more comprehensive demonstration where I can show you our platform visually and we can discuss implementation specifically for your business. This gives us more time to really dive deep into your needs."

[Phone Demo Approach]
*If they choose phone demo:*

"Perfect! Let me walk you through a typical day at {{companyName}} and show you where AI could make the biggest impact..."

*Structure the demo around their specific challenges:*
1. **Problem identification**: "Right now, when a customer contacts you about [specific issue], what's that process like?"
2. **Solution demonstration**: "Here's how our AI would handle that same situation..."
3. **Benefit quantification**: "This typically saves businesses like yours about [X hours/week] and reduces costs by [Y%]"
4. **Implementation simplicity**: "The best part is, this integrates with your existing systems in just a few days"

[Scheduling In-Person Demo]
*If they choose in-person demo:*

"Excellent choice! The in-person demo really lets us dive deep into your specific needs. I have availability [provide 2-3 specific time options]. What works best for you?"

**Information to collect:**
- Preferred date and time
- Location preference (their office, our office, or virtual meeting)
- Other key decision-makers who should attend
- Specific areas of their business they want to focus on

"I'll send you a calendar invitation with all the details, and I'll prepare a customized demonstration focused specifically on {{industry}} and your specific challenges."

[Handling Objections & Building Value]

**"We're not ready for AI yet"**
"I understand that feeling. Most of our clients felt the same way initially. But here's the thing - you're already behind your competitors if you're not at least exploring these options. The businesses that are thriving right now started with small, manageable AI implementations. We can start small and scale up as you see results."

**"It sounds expensive"**
"I appreciate you being direct about budget concerns. Most of our clients actually save money within the first quarter because of the efficiency gains. Our smallest package starts at less than what most businesses spend on a part-time employee, but it works 24/7 and never calls in sick. Let me show you the ROI calculator during our demo."

**"We need to think about it"**
"Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specific questions or concerns do you have that I can address right now? I'd rather you make an informed decision than a hasty one. What would help you feel more confident about moving forward?"

**"We've tried AI before and it didn't work"**
"That's actually really valuable information. What specifically didn't work? Many early AI implementations failed because they weren't properly customized or integrated. We've learned from those mistakes and our approach is very different. Let me show you how we do it differently."

[Natural Conversation Flow]
- Ask open-ended questions and really listen to their responses
- Share relevant stories and examples from similar businesses
- Be genuinely curious about their business and challenges
- Don't rush - let conversations develop naturally
- Show enthusiasm for helping them succeed, not just making a sale

[Closing & Next Steps]
*After demo or scheduling:*

"{{customerName}}, I'm really excited about the potential here. Based on our conversation, I can see how AI could significantly impact your business operations and growth. "

*If they had a phone demo:*
"What questions do you have? And would you like me to put together a customized proposal showing exactly how this would work for {{companyName}}?"

*If they scheduled an in-person demo:*
"Perfect! You'll receive the calendar invitation within the hour. In the meantime, I'll prepare a demonstration specifically focused on your key challenges. Is there anything specific you'd like me to make sure we cover?"

**Always end with:**
"I'm going to make sure all of this gets properly documented in our system so we can provide you with the best possible follow-up. You should expect to hear from me [specific timeframe] with [specific next step]. Do you have any other questions I can answer right now?"

*If they say they didn't request a demo:*
