# Airtable Chat Leads Integration Plan

## Executive Summary

Replace problematic HubSpot integration for incomplete chat leads (name + phone only) with Airtable storage, implementing a dual-system architecture that routes complete leads to HubSpot and incomplete leads to Airtable for nurturing until complete.

---

## Current Problem Analysis

### HubSpot Email Validation Issues
- **Dummy Email Rejection**: `firstname.sessionid@chat-lead.local` fails validation
- **Domain Requirements**: HubSpot requires real domains with MX records
- **Data Integrity**: Forced dummy emails pollute CRM with invalid contact data
- **Compliance Risk**: Fake emails may trigger spam filters and deliverability issues

### Chat Lead Reality
- **30-40% of chat leads** provide only name + phone number
- **Users expect immediate response** via phone call (VAPI integration)
- **Email collection** happens during follow-up conversations
- **Current workflow** forces invalid data into primary CRM

---

## Proposed Solution: Dual-System Architecture

### System Routing Logic

```
Chat Lead Detected
├── Has Email Address? 
│   ├── YES → Route to HubSpot (Complete Lead)
│   └── NO → Route to Airtable (Incomplete Lead)
├── VAPI Call Initiated
├── Follow-up Conversation
└── Complete Data → Transfer to HubSpot
```

### Benefits of Dual System
1. **Clean Data**: No dummy emails polluting primary CRM
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Avoid HubSpot contact limits for incomplete leads
3. **Better Tracking**: Specialized fields for chat-specific data
4. **Flexible Routing**: Easy to modify criteria as business evolves
5. **Compliance**: Real email addresses only in marketing systems

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Airtable Base Setup

#### Base Structure: "Chat Leads"
**Table: Incomplete Leads**

| Field Name | Field Type | Description | Required |
|------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| `recordId` | Formula | Auto-generated unique ID | Auto |
| `firstName` | Single Line Text | Extracted from message | Yes |
| `lastName` | Single Line Text | Extracted from message | Yes |  
| `phone` | Phone Number | E.164 format | Yes |
| `message` | Long Text | Original chat message | Yes |
| `sessionId` | Single Line Text | Chat session identifier | Yes |
| `timestamp` | Date/Time | Lead creation time | Auto |
| `leadSource` | Single Select | Always "chat" | Auto |
| `intentClassification` | Long Text | AI classification JSON | Yes |
| `vapiCallStatus` | Single Select | pending, completed, failed | Auto |
| `vapiCallId` | Single Line Text | VAPI call identifier | Optional |
| `status` | Single Select | new, contacted, qualified, converted | Auto |
| `hubspotMigrated` | Checkbox | Transferred to HubSpot | Auto |
| `hubspotContactId` | Single Line Text | HubSpot ID after transfer | Optional |
| `notes` | Long Text | Follow-up notes | Optional |

#### Airtable Views
1. **New Leads** (status = "new")
2. **Pending VAPI Calls** (vapiCallStatus = "pending") 
3. **Ready for HubSpot** (email collected, not migrated)
4. **Converted Leads** (hubspotMigrated = true)

### Phase 2: N8N Workflow Modifications

#### Current Workflow Enhancement Points

**Node: Check Contact Info**
- Current: Routes to HubSpot if name OR phone detected
- **New Logic**: Route based on email presence
  ```javascript
  // Route to HubSpot (complete lead)
  if (hasEmail && (hasName || hasPhone)) {
    return 'hubspot';
  }
  // Route to Airtable (incomplete lead)  
  else if (hasName || hasPhone) {
    return 'airtable';
  }
  // Continue conversation
  else {
    return 'continue';
  }
  ```

**New Node: Create Airtable Lead**
- **Type**: HTTP Request (Airtable API)
- **Purpose**: Store incomplete contact data
- **Trigger**: When email missing but name/phone present

**Enhanced Node: Extract Contact Details** 
- **Dual Output**: Format data for both Airtable and HubSpot
- **Classification Data**: Include full AI intent analysis
- **Metadata**: Chat session, timestamp, lead source

#### Workflow Routing Updates

```
Current Flow:
Check Contact Info → Extract Contact Details → Create HubSpot Lead → VAPI Call

New Dual Flow:
Check Contact Info 
├── Complete Lead → Extract Contact Details → Create HubSpot Lead → VAPI Call
└── Incomplete Lead → Extract Contact Details → Create Airtable Lead → VAPI Call
```

### Phase 3: Airtable API Integration

#### Authentication
- **Method**: Personal Access Token (PAT) 
- **Scopes**: `data:read`, `data:write`
- **Base Access**: Specific to Chat Leads base
- **Storage**: n8n credentials (encrypted)

#### API Endpoints

**Create Record Endpoint:**
```
POST https://api.airtable.com/v0/{baseId}/Incomplete%20Leads
```

**Request Body Format:**
```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "fields": {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Smith", 
        "phone": "+15551234567",
        "message": "Original chat message",
        "sessionId": "abc123def",
        "intentClassification": "{AI classification JSON}",
        "status": "new",
        "vapiCallStatus": "pending"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Update Record for VAPI Results:**
```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": "recXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
      "fields": {
        "vapiCallStatus": "completed",
        "vapiCallId": "call_12345",
        "status": "contacted"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 4: VAPI Integration Enhancement

#### Current VAPI Call Node Updates
- **Airtable Integration**: Update record with call status
- **Call Context**: Pass Airtable record ID for tracking
- **Success Handling**: Mark call completed in both systems

#### Enhanced VAPI Assistant Variables
```json
{
  "assistantOverrides": {
    "variableValues": {
      "customerName": "{{firstName}} {{lastName}}",
      "leadSource": "chat_incomplete", 
      "airtableRecordId": "{{recordId}}",
      "intentData": "{{intentClassification}}",
      "collectMissingData": "true"
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase 5: Data Migration & Follow-up

#### Airtable to HubSpot Transfer Logic

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Email address collected during VAPI call
- Lead status = "qualified" 
- hubspotMigrated = false

**Transfer Process:**
1. **Create HubSpot Contact** with complete data
2. **Update Airtable Record**: 
   - hubspotMigrated = true
   - hubspotContactId = {HubSpot ID}
   - status = "converted"
3. **Maintain Airtable Record** for historical tracking

#### Data Synchronization 
- **One-way Transfer**: Airtable → HubSpot (when complete)
- **Historical Tracking**: Keep Airtable records for attribution
- **Regular Cleanup**: Archive old converted records

## API Configuration Details

### Airtable HTTP Request Node Setup

**Authentication:**
```json
{
  "authentication": "headerAuth",
  "nodeCredentialType": "httpHeaderAuth",
  "httpHeaderAuth": {
    "name": "Authorization",
    "value": "Bearer {AIRTABLE_PAT}"
  }
}
```

**Headers:**
```json
{
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "User-Agent": "n8n-insight-intelligence-chatbot/1.0"
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- **Rate Limits**: 5 requests/second (built-in retry)
- **Validation Errors**: Log and continue with fallback
- **Network Issues**: Retry 3x with exponential backoff

### N8N Expression Examples

**Dynamic Record Creation:**
```javascript
// Create Airtable record from chat data
{
  "records": [{
    "fields": {
      "firstName": "{{ $node['Extract Contact Details'].json.firstName }}",
      "lastName": "{{ $node['Extract Contact Details'].json.lastName }}",
      "phone": "{{ $node['Extract Contact Details'].json.phone }}",
      "message": "{{ $node['Extract Message Data'].json.message }}",
      "sessionId": "{{ $node['Extract Message Data'].json.sessionId }}",
      "intentClassification": "{{ JSON.stringify($node['Process Intent Classification'].json) }}",
      "timestamp": "{{ new Date().toISOString() }}"
    }
  }]
}
```

## Business Logic & Rules

### Lead Routing Decision Matrix

| Has Email | Has Name | Has Phone | Route To | Reason |
|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | HubSpot | Complete lead data |
| ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | HubSpot | Email enables marketing |
| ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | HubSpot | Email + phone sufficient |
| ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Airtable | Incomplete, needs nurturing |
| ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | Continue Chat | Insufficient for lead |
| ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Continue Chat | Phone only insufficient |
| ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Continue Chat | No contact information |

### Lead Status Progression

**Airtable Statuses:**
1. **new** → Initial creation from chat
2. **contacted** → VAPI call completed
3. **qualified** → Intent to proceed identified  
4. **converted** → Migrated to HubSpot with email

**HubSpot Statuses:**
1. **New Lead** → Direct from complete chat form
2. **Contacted** → Follow-up completed  
3. **Qualified** → Ready for sales process
4. **Customer** → Converted to paying customer
