# AI Intent Classification Implementation Plan

## Project Overview: Replacing Static Regex with AI-Powered Intent Detection

### Current State Analysis

**Existing Implementation:**
- File: `insight-intelligence-ai-chatbot-handler-jsonbin-memory.json`
- Current Node: "Check Lead Intent" (line 89-96)
- Method: Static regex pattern matching
- Pattern: `(demo|schedule|meeting|call|pricing|contact|sales|book|appointment|speak|talk|human|agent|consultation|quote|proposal|interested|buy|purchase|solution)`

**Limitations of Current Approach:**
1. **Binary Classification**: Only detects "lead intent" vs "standard conversation"
2. **Keyword Dependency**: Misses contextual intent without specific keywords
3. **No Confidence Scoring**: Can't assess certainty of intent classification
4. **Limited Dimensionality**: Doesn't capture urgency, business context, or lead quality
5. **Maintenance Overhead**: Requires manual keyword updates

Replace single regex-based "Check Lead Intent" node with comprehensive AI classification system:

```
Extract Message Data → AI Intent Classification → Intelligent Routing → Context-Aware Response Generation
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Intent Classification Schema

Using OpenAI Structured Outputs with this JSON schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "primary_intent": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["information_gathering", "demo_request", "pricing_inquiry", "technical_support", "lead_qualification", "objection_handling", "scheduling", "general_conversation"]
    },
    "lead_quality": {
      "type": "string", 
      "enum": ["hot", "warm", "cold", "nurture"]
    },
    "urgency_level": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["immediate", "soon", "flexible", "exploring"]
    },
    "business_context": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["existing_customer", "competitor_research", "budget_approved", "early_stage", "decision_maker", "influencer"]
    },
    "specific_interests": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["ai_phone_system", "website_chat", "crm_integration", "roi_analysis", "implementation_timeline", "support_training"]
      }
    },
    "conversation_stage": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["introduction", "discovery", "presentation", "objection", "closing", "follow_up"]
    },
    "confidence_score": {
      "type": "number",
      "minimum": 0,
      "maximum": 1
    },
    "next_best_action": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["continue_conversation", "request_contact_info", "schedule_demo", "provide_pricing", "escalate_to_human", "send_resources"]
    }
  },
  "required": ["primary_intent", "lead_quality", "urgency_level", "confidence_score", "next_best_action"]
}
```

### 2. AI Classification Node Configuration

**Node Name:** "AI Intent Classification"
**Type:** `n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest`
**Method:** POST
**URL:** `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`

**jsonBody Structure:**
```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system", 
      "content": "You are an expert intent classifier for business conversations. Analyze the user's message and classify their intent across multiple dimensions..."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "{{$node['Extract Message Data'].json['message']}}"
    }
  ],
  "response_format": {
    "type": "json_schema",
    "json_schema": {
      "name": "intent_classification",
      "schema": { /* Schema from above */ }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Intelligent Routing Implementation

**Enhanced Conditional Logic:**

1. **Hot Lead Path** (`lead_quality: "hot"` AND `urgency_level: "immediate"`)
   - Route: Direct to contact info collection → HubSpot → VAPI call
   
2. **Warm Lead Path** (`lead_quality: "warm"` OR `next_best_action: "request_contact_info"`)
   - Route: Enhanced lead response → Contact info check → CRM integration
   
3. **Nurture Path** (`lead_quality: "cold"` OR `conversation_stage: "discovery"`)
   - Route: Educational response → Continue conversation
   
4. **Immediate Action Path** (`next_best_action: "schedule_demo"` OR `next_best_action: "escalate_to_human"`)
   - Route: Direct action execution

### 4. Context-Aware Response Generation

**Updated AI Prompts:** Include intent classification data for personalized responses:

```json
{
  "role": "system",
  "content": "You are Layla, AI business consultant for Insight Intelligence. Context: User intent classified as {{$node['AI Intent Classification'].json['primary_intent']}} with {{$node['AI Intent Classification'].json['lead_quality']}} lead quality and {{$node['AI Intent Classification'].json['urgency_level']}} urgency. Their specific interests include {{$node['AI Intent Classification'].json['specific_interests']}}. Recommended next action: {{$node['AI Intent Classification'].json['next_best_action']}}..."
}
```

- Avoid line breaks in content strings

### Error Handling
- Implement fallback to existing regex logic if AI classification fails
- Add confidence threshold checks for uncertain classifications
- Include timeout handling for OpenAI API requests

### Testing Strategy
- Unit test each intent classification scenario
- A/B test conversation success rates
- Monitor classification accuracy vs human review
- Validate routing logic with edge cases

### Performance Optimization
- Cache similar message classifications to reduce API calls
- Implement batch processing for high-volume scenarios
- Monitor OpenAI API usage and costs
